# randomQuoteGenerator
<ul>
<li>A quote generator that changes quotes every 5 seconds unless the button is pressed. The quotes are not repeated unless
the total number of quotes are finished. </li>
<li>The program changes to a random color every time the quote changes. There is a color pool out of which random colors
are generated since many colors are undesirable and not pleasent to the user. </li>
<li>The program also allows users to add as many quotes as they want with whatever properties they choose such as
source,year,tags etc. The program will work no matter how many quotes you enter. </li>
<li>You can also update the color pool to add more pleasing colors. The colors are not repeated unless the color pool has 
been used entirely once. </li>
<li>This project uses vanilla javascript only. </li>
</ul>
